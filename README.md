## Requirement
Write a solution for the pizzeria problem from Assignment #1 using MVC and Object Oriented PHP. 
You may use CakePHP if you like. 
Keep track of Sessions as necessary and save each order to a MySQL Database.
Allow Pizzeria employees to login to an "admin" section to view current and past orders. They must also be able to mark orders as "complete" (and therefore moving the order from current to past). They may also be able to edit orders or delete orders.

- There are two users : ADMIN, USER
- Keep track of session is necessary
- Save order to MY SQL
- Admin which can be employee or system admin, can view current and past orders

- Write database scheme as single SQL
```
